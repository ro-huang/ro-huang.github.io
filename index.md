I'm Rowan Huang. 50% of my selfhood is well captured by the following three identities: researcher, reader, and runner. I'm still searching for the remaining 50%.

I graduated Duke in 2024 as a statistics major and worked as a economics predoctoral research fellow with [Amy Finkelstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amy_Finkelstein) at MIT. During this time, I've thought lots about health economics and policy, innovation, and what it means to be empirically rigorous in the social sciences. 

Starting January 2026, I'll be joining [Fulcrum Research](https://fulcrumresearch.ai/) to work on scaling human oversight.
